### **Overview**
 
The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism (the "Fund") was set up on 28 November, 2011, at the launch of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s new book, “My Lifelong Challenge: Singapore’s Bilingual Journey”. The Fund is set up as a company limited by guarantee, with Charity and Institution of a Public Character status.

Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning English and the Mother Tongue Languages helps prepare our children to plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage.

The Fund has been set up to supplement efforts by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in the teaching and learning of English and the Mother Tongue Languages.
 
### **What the Fund Does**
 
Our MTL, heritage and culture forms an integral part of Singapore's identity and asset. The Fund supports proposals that encourage bilingualism and the learning of our MTLs as a living language and lifelong endeavour.

### **Our Structure**
 
The Fund is managed by a Board and advised by an International Advisory Panel (IAP) of experts. The Board is supported by a Project Evaluation Committee (PEC), Publicity and Outreach Committee (POC), Investment Advisory Committee (IAC) and Audit Committee (AC).
