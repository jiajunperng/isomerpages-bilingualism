### **Call for Proposals**

The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism invites you to submit proposals to promote bilingualism among pre-school children. 

Bilingual education is a cornerstone of our education system. Learning two languages helps Singaporeans plug into a globalised world and strengthen links to our Asian heritage.

Research has shown that exposure in early years is effective for nurturing bilingualism and the learning of multiple languages. Strengthening our efforts to encourage bilingualism in the early years, especially in listening and speaking capabilities, would provide our children with a headstart in language acquisition and lay a stronger foundation for bilingual learning in their later years.

The Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism recently announced our latest call for proposal. If you have ideas that have the potential to create an impact on promoting bilingualism among pre-school children in pre-schools, at home and in the community, the Fund invites you to submit your proposal. 

**Interested applicants can refer to the Fund Application Guidelines and complete the Application Form below.**
