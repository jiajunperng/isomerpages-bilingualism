Your donation will help our children build their language foundation early in an age-appropriate way. In support of this cause, the government has provided a 1:1 matching grant for donations to the Fund, up to a cap of $50 million. Donations to the Fund will also qualify for 250% tax deduction (at two and a half times the amount of donation). Names and tax reference numbers have to be provided in order to be eligible for the tax deductions.
